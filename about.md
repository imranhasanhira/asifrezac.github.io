Hi!
I am Asif Reza Chowdhury. I am a mechanical engineer by academic standards but deep in my heart I am a finance enthusiast with a knack for business and capital market with endless entreprenurial drives. I am currently working as an investment analyst at Asian Tiger Capital Partners (BD) Ltd - an invevstment bank cum asset management company in Dhaka with about BDT 800 million in AUM.
I am a movie freak (most probably genetically from the patrirchial side) and a begineer level audiophile with taste for music of classical Bengali and 80's English pops.

This website will be basically my digital wall magazine as well as a portfolio of mine, where I will most of the time post reviews of movies, tech gadgets and apps, books, tv series etc etc.
